## Inventory Management System

A fast, modern dashboard to manage products, track stock levels, and surface insights. Built with Next.js App Router, Prisma, and a clean, recruiter-friendly UI.

### ✨ Highlights

- **Real-time-ish UX**: route-level loading states with a clean spinner and persistent sidebar.
- **Inventory features**: add products, view inventory, low-stock timestamping, and basic analytics.
- **Auth-ready**: integrated with `@stackframe/stack` for authentication UI.
- **Type-safe data**: Prisma schema and generated client checked into `src/generated` for reliability.

### 🧭 App Structure

- `app/` — App Router pages: `dashboard`, `inventory`, `add-product`, `settings`, global `layout` and `loading`.
- `components/` — shared UI like `sidebar`, `pagination`, `products-chart`.
- `lib/` — server actions and auth helpers (e.g., `lib/actions/products.ts`).
- `prisma/` — schema, migrations, and seed script.

### 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites: Node 18+, PostgreSQL (or configured Prisma datasource).

1. Install deps

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure database

Create a `.env` with your database URL:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/inventory"
```

3. Run migrations and seed (optional)

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed # optional
```

4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

### 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15 / App Router** for routing, layouts, and streaming UI
- **TypeScript** end-to-end
- **Prisma** ORM with migrations
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Stack (stackframe)** for auth UI widgets
- **Lucide** icons

### 📸 Key Features (User Flow)

- Sign in and land on the **Dashboard** with a quick view of totals and trends.

### 🗂️ Important Files

- `app/layout.tsx` — global layout, fonts, metadata
- `app/loading.tsx` — spinner-based route loading screen with sidebar
- `lib/actions/products.ts` — server actions for product CRUD
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — database schema

### 🔧 Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run start` — start production server
- `npx prisma studio` — inspect the database

### 🌐 Deployment

Deploy anywhere that supports Node (Vercel recommended). Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set and run `prisma migrate deploy` during build/start.

### 🧭 Roadmap Ideas

- Role-based access and activity logs
- Advanced analytics and CSV export
- Bulk edits and barcode scanning
- Webhooks/integrations (Shopify, Stripe)
